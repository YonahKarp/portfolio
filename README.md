# Resume
My personal resume website. https://yonahkarp.com/

This website is based on https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template, but has a bunch of added fun animation and features, like:
- Aroura animation added in head section
- Resume items animate in
- Skill bars animate to fill
- Portfolio section has perspective animation
- (un)Fixed the background attachment on mobile size screens
- Added interview availability calendar 


The code is a bit messy, as the original developer was new to React and didn't use scss. But it gets the job done nicely, and it's not worth the time to pretty up the code for the same functionality (when I can spend 30 seconds and just write this disclaimer instead)
